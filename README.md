# Git Demo 2

This is a repository for practicing pull requests.

## What to do

1. You will fork this project by clicking on the "fork" button on the top right corner, at which point your should have your own forked version of this project under your account on Github.
2. Clone this project to your local computer.
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b a-branch-name`. Replace a-branch-name with a descriptive name of your choice.
4. Do `git status` to see that you are indeed on this branch.
5. Make a couple of commits to this branch. I suggest adding a file of your choice, and then committing another change to that file.
6. Push the changes to GitHub: `git push -u origin a-branch-name`, again replacing a-branch-name with the name of your branch.
7. Go to github.com, find your project. Click on the "Branch" dropdown button. It may say "Branch: master". Select the new branch you've created.
